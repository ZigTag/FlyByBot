# PR Template

## Tips

It is useful to create a draft PR as soon as you have pushed your first commit. This will allow us to see who is working on what, and will enable the community to give active feedback on your work.

When your PR is ready, mark it as `Ready for Review`. One of the maintainers will then merge it into staging. Once it has been tested in staging, it will be merged into master, meaning it will be available with the main FBW bot.

Remember, you need to point your PR to the FBW staging branch.

## Title

Please use the appropriate prefix in your PR title:

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation only changes
- style: Formatting, missing semi-colons, white-space, etc
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding missing tests
- chore: Maintain. Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools/libraries/documentation

## Description

For the PR message, give a desctiption about what you have added/changed, what it does, and what the command/alias is.

You will also need to attach a screenshot of your command from your test bot. This will help us speed up the process of reviewing the PR.
